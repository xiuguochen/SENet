# SENet
**S**mart **E**llipsometry **N**etwork (SENet): a method for achieving fully automated intelligent ellipsometry data analysis.

This repository contains the source codes for the neural networks used in SENet.

Codes for ReflectoNet (https://doi.org/10.1088/2053-1583/acc59b) and SUNDIAL (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41377-021-00482-0) were built by ourselves with some modifications.
